    <string name="description_1">Design not about making something beautiful, it is about making something great. You can do a great app by many ways, but one of my favorites is to make it the simplest and intuitive as possible, yet being original. </string>
    <string name="description_2">Thanks to the efforts of Yuichi Araki in the Google Developer Relations team, we’ve finally finished that back-port and the capabilities of KitKat transitions are available all the way back to the Ice Cream Sandwich release.
